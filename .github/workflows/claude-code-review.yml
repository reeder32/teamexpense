          custom_instructions: |
            You are reviewing a TypeScript expense tracker app (Node/Express + React + SQLite).
            Focus on:
            1. SQL injection and authentication vulnerabilities
            2. Logic errors and off-by-one bugs
            3. Performance issues and memory leaks
            4. UI/UX and accessibility violations
            Be thorough — flag every issue you find with file, line, severity, and explanation.
